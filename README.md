This workshop will introduce the professional practice, language, and methodology of design for the web. The goal of the workshop is to provide a solid basis for a journalist working with a web design team.

Over the course of this workshop, we will be introducing and discussing both the technical structures of web design as well as the independent disciplines within the field. You will produce a project that combines your journalistic process with one of the disciplines of web design, which will be presented and discussed on the last day of the workshop.

### Preparation

#### Suggested Reading

The below articles from [_A List Apart_](http://alistapart.com/) are a small sampler on the language, scope, and approaches of contemporary web design and how it got there. They should give an overview, or at least a frame of reference, of the ground to be covered in the workshop without a large amount of technical jargon. Exploring _A List Apart_ further is highly encouraged.
