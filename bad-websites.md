# These Websites are Bad
##  ** [Mr. Bottles] (http://www.mrbottles.com)**
1. When you first open the site there’s a pop-up video of a guy introducing the site. The visitor doesn’t get a chance to check out the site first. If you go to a different page on the site and come back to the homepage, he starts up again. 

2. How the owner displays recent news is haphazard. The font color changes for each entry making it He uses a different color for each entry so there’s no consistency. Additionally, the site owner puts the whole text for each entry on the main page instead of just having a date and headline with a link to the full entry.  The main paige has entries from 7/23/14 to 2/20/08. 

3. There is a warning buoy icon on the right side of the page that stays with you as you scroll down. Pressing it returns you to the top of any page on the site no matter how short it may be. The buoy is intrusive because of its size and bright color. Instead of having links to Hall of Fame, articles, and Bottle Talk laid out at the the top of the page, they’re hidden under “of interest,” while they’re laid out in small, red print at the bottom of the page.
