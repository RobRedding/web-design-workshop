# These Websites are Good
##  **[Canvasmagazine.net] (http://www.canvasmagazine.net)** 
Canvas is an Australian online fashion magazine. I like this website for its simple and consistent layout. Every post has a headline, picture, and at least the start of the story. There’s a simple read more button at the bottom of the post if the story continues. At the top of the page you aren’t overwhelmed with choices. There’s only Issues, Features, Archives, and Subscribe. I also like that the site doesn’t feel the need to take up the whole page and leaves the right side clear with just a simple grey background. The posts them selves start with text before scrolling down to uniformly laid out pictures.
